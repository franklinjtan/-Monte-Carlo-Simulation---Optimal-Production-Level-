# Optimal Production Level Simulation
* Create a simulation on Python that will generate a recommendation given a set of parameters
* Parameters: unit price, retail price, cost of disposing, and number of units to manufacture

## Function Objectives
* Randomly generate demand instances
* Compute the profit for a given demand and store it in  alist
* Compute mean and standard deviation of the profit
* Identify the optimal level of production
